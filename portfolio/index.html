<h2 id="AboutMe">About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Isaiah Francis, I am a graphic design student at SAIT in the <a href="https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/diplomas/interactive-design-graphic-design-major">Interactive Design</a> major. I have always had a creative eye, and love to incorporate my creative self and interests in my projects and pieces. Growing up I was a competative athlete, I competed in skiing, mountain biking, golf, and skateboarding. I have always had in interest in incoprating my passion of photography and videography with my interests and hobbies. I love taking automotive photography, and sports photography, specifically the sports I play. Since my trip to Montreal, Canada in April of 2023 I finally got to experience the scene of underground electronic music. I have met lots of people and still to this day meet more people who are in the scene, whether just enjoyers of the music, djs, photographers, and the people who put these shows on. Much like the world of skateboarding and skiing, I find many people are a like and the possibilities of meeting new people is endless. Since my trip, I was also introduced to the local Calgarian EDM and rave scene, from little shows being put up in clubs, to legal and illegal outdoor bush raves. The community is amazing, and I truly think the music brings people together.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>

    <p>I have always had a lot of hobbies growing up, from photography and videography, various sports like skiing, mountain biking, and skateboarding. In my freetime I enjoy creating digital graphic pieces from photos that I take daily. I always find myself taking photographs throughout my day, whenever I see something interesting that sparks my eye, you can ensure I am going to capture it. 
    </p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

    <p>A goal of mine is to graduate from <a href="https://www.sait.ca/">SAIT</a>, and find myself a job in this field as a graphic designer, or something in the field of photo and video. I want to express my creative side into the workforce. If I could land myself a job where I get to incorporate my interests with my creative side I think I would find my work would exeed expectations and I would find myself happy doing so. Being able to travel around for my work one day does also interest me, though I have not travelled a lot, the times I have I love experiencing new places, new cultures, and meeting new people.
